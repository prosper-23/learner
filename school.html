     <p>
       I did my ordinary level education from two schools
       <ul>
        <li>Petit Semianire saint Pie X de Nyundo (Minor seminary of Nyundo)</li>
         <li>Ecole Secondaire saint Jean de Murunda (Murunda Secondary school)</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
       <br>
       <p>
         I studied in monor seminary of Nyundo during the first year in 2017 and at the end of the year, I changed school and that is when I went to Murunda secondary school.

   <h2 id="AL">ADVANCED LEVEL</h2>
   <p>
    In 2020, I started my Advanced level at <abbr title="Groupe Scholaire Officielle de Butare">GSOB</abbr>  in the combination of <abbr title="Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics">PCM. I was among the best performer un the class and I got the first position in  in the first period of the term and that is when the coronavirus came.</abbr>.<br />
    The outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19 had changed everything. Schools stopped operating and we had to go to our place and it was suggested that we would go back after two weeks but it took longer than we expected, six months.
